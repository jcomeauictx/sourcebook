* paperback (at least) has these problems:
    - in headings, an underscore isn't displayed but acts as <sub> tag
    - listings linewidth could stand to be a lot longer, at least 3/4 inch;
      lines of gpl2 are wrapping unnecessarily
    - wrapped lines are indenting, that should already be turned off
